        Choose a gem name. Make sure it''s not already taken on RubyGems.org.\n\n2.
        Create a directory with the gem name.\n\n3. Initialize the gem with `bundle
        gem <gem name>`. This will create the necessary folder structure and files.\n\n4.
        Edit the .gemspec file with details about your gem like summary, description,
        authors, etc. \n\n5. Write your code! Add files like lib/gem_name.rb, bin/gem_name,
        etc.\n\n6. Update the README.md with instructions and documentation for your
        gem.\n\n7. Commit to git and push to GitHub.\n\n8. Build the gem with `gem
        build <gem name>.gemspec`\n\n9. Push the gem to RubyGems with `gem push <gem
        name>-<version>.gem`\n\n10. Update your gem with `gem update <gem name>` and
        release new versions with `gem push <new version>.gem`\n\n11. Profit! Your
        gem is now available for anyone to use in their Ruby projects.\n\nThat covers
        the basic steps. Let me know if you have any other questions!","stop_reason":"stop_sequence","stop":"\n\nHuman:"}'
