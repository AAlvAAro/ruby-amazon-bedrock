[![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/AAlvAAro/ruby-amazon-bedrock.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/AAlvAAro/ruby-amazon-bedrock)

Seamless Integration with Amazon Bedrock API for AI-Powered Text and Image Generation in Ruby ðŸ¤– + ðŸ’Ž. [Amazon Bedrock API](https://aws.amazon.com/es/bedrock/).

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API, so you can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case.

### Bundler

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "ruby-amazon-bedrock"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

### Gem install

Or install with:

```bash
$ gem install ruby-amazon-bedrock
```

and require with:

```ruby
require "amazon-bedrock"
```

## Credentials

In order to use Amazon Bedrock, you'll need your secure credentials just as any other AWS service. Get your keys from AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam)

### Quickstart

For a quick test you can pass your token directly to a new client:

```ruby
client = RubyAmazonBedrock::Client.new(aws_region: "your_aws_region", aws_access_key_id: "your_access_key_id", aws_access_token: "your_access_token")
```

```

Claude 2

```ruby
client.invoke_model('anthropic.claude-v2', 'Your prompt goes here ...')
```

Claude 2.1

<!-- TODO: Add this model to the Anthropic library -->

```ruby
client.invoke_model('anthropic.claude-v2:1', 'Your prompt goes here ...')
```

### Cohere

Cohere models are text generation models for business use cases. Cohere models are trained on data that supports reliable business applications, like text generation, summarization, copywriting, dialogue, extraction, and question answering.

How to call Cohere command models:

Command
